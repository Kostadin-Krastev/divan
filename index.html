                120 Allen Street located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and is
                comprised
                of sixteen furnished
                studios and four furnished apartments with commercial space at grade. Grzywinski+Pons designed the
                building, the interiors, and much of the furniture. Located on an infill lot in a classically gritty LES
                tenement block, the property - while very narrow is block-through and as such has frontage on both Allen
                and Orchard Streets. To accommodate the allowable floor area on such a small footprint, we bifurcated
                the mass on the north-south axis creating a slender ten-storey tower on the Allen Street side.

                New office space of payment processing company Paysafe located in Sofia,
                Bulgaria was designed by DIVAN.
                The most intriguing task when designing the new Paysafe office space inSofia was to make a combination
                between a calm working environment with 600 workstations retain the portliness of the company having in
                mind that it is the second worldwide largest dealing with online payments and yet get away from the
                boring open space office. We took an advantage of the different products/services Paysafe offer -
                Skrill, Netteler, Paysafecard and incorporated their corporative color identity as colorful accents on
                the three different floors space is located.
